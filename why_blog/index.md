# Why Blog?


### English as a Second Language

In order to understand the reason for my goal for this blog, you would need to have a little background. As an Afghan refugee, I came to United States with a few words of English; "_thank you_", "_please_", and "_can I have some water please?_". While, they were a great start, the words didn't get me far but definitely kept me hydrated. Luckily, my family and I came across countless selfless people who helped us learn the language. During elementary school, a wonderful volunteer would come to my school and we would sit outside of my classroom in the hallway and learn English through workbooks or reading some books. 

While my English improved, it was always worse than my fellow classmates. Luckily for me, mathematics was the same regardless of it being in Dari or in Farsi or in English. I started to focus on mathematics and continually justified my sub-par[^1] scores by saying, "_English is not my mother tongue_", "_I am not good at language_". I continued to have this mindset until I slowly got into self-help books. It was through reading countless self-help books and listening to many speeches and TED talks that I started to plant the seed of a growth mindset.


### Why blog?
Over the years, I have really focused on developing my skills with a strong focus on some aspects of soft skills and learning artificial intelligence and machine learning. With this blog, I hope to improve my written communication through sharing my thoughts and experiences around varies subjects. I will primarily focus on technology, personal projects, and anything that has captured my mind and thoughts. With respect to technology, I will focus on learning Kubernetes and Go in the beginning and it will evolve as I focus on different projects. In the process, it would be amazing if this blog teaches the reader something new and/or inspires them to have a growth mindset.  


<b>"Unfolding my own myth"</b><br />
On the homepage, you might noticed that I state that I am "_unfolding my own myth_". This is an inspiration from Rumi's poem, "Unfold Your Own Myth". Rumi or Jalal al-Din Balkhi or Mawlana was an Afghan poet that has be an inspiration for me and many Americans. While I enjoy many of his poems, this one has been very motivational and inspiring.

<b>Unfold Your Own Myth</b><br />
<em>by: Rumi</em>

Who gets up early to discover the moment light begins? <br />
Who finds us here circling, bewildered, like atoms? <br />
Who, like Jacob blind with grief and age, <br />
smells the shirt of his lost son <br />
and can see again? <br />

Who lets a bucket down and brings up <br />
a flowing prophet? Or like Moses goes for fire <br />
and finds what burns inside the sunrise? <br />

Jesus slips into a house to escape enemies, <br />
and opens a door to the other world. <br />
Solomon cuts open a fish, and there's a gold ring. <br />
Omar storms in to kill the prophet <br />
and leaves with blessings. <br />

<b>But don't be satisfied with stories, how things <br />
have gone with others. Unfold <br />
your own myth, so everyone will understand <br />
the passage, <em>We have opened you.</em></b> <br />

Start walking toward Shams. Your legs will get heavy <br />
and tired. Then comes a moment of feeling <br />
the wings you've grown, lifting. <br />

As I am unfolding my own myth, I hope that you can join me on the journey and hopefully, I can inspire you to unfold your own myth.
