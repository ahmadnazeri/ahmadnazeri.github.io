[{"categories":null,"content":"Let‚Äôs Make a Deal The Monty Hall problem is based on the game show, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Make a Deal‚Äù, originally hosted by Monty Hall himself. The contestant on the show was presented with three doors and asked to pick one door. Let‚Äôs say you pick Door 1. Then Monty Hall, the host, will open one of the others to show that it‚Äôs not the car. You are then asked if you would like to switch doors. Would you believe me if I told you it is a better decision to switch doors? Mathematically, you have a $66.6666$% chance of getting the car by switching doors.

In the beginning, you had a $1/3$ chance of selecting the car. And a $2/3$ chance of not selecting the car or a $2/3$ chance that the car is in the other doors. And when a non-car door is opened and you are asked if you would switch then it means that the other has a $2/3$ of having the car behind it. Thus, it is best to switch doors. I would recommend Numberphile‚Äôs video on Monty Hall Problem.

Essentially, I implemented the game show for any number of doors that user provides as long as there are at least 3 doors. And you pick the trials too. Below is a table of percentages the car was in the first door picked vs the door you switch for: Trials First Choice Door Switch Door 1 0.00% 100.00% 10 40.00% 60.00% 100 32.00% 68.00% 1000 33.10% 66.90% 10000 34.06% 65.94% 1000000 33.30% 66.70% 10000000 33.31% 66.69% 100000000 33.33% 66.67% While with three doors, we can see that switch door had the car roughly around $2/3$ or $66.67$% of the time. The percentages become more apparent when you leverage more than 3 doors. Below is the results of when we have 100 doors and you are asked to switch after 98 doors have been opened for you. Trials First Choice Door Switch Door 1 0.00% 100.00% 10 0.00% 100.00% 100 1.00% 99.00% 1000 0.70% 99.30% 10000 1.18% 98.82% 1000000 0.99% 99.01% As the data shows, you have roughly $99/100$ or $99$% chance of picking the car by switching doors at the end.

As an Afghan refugee, I came to United States with a few words of English; ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, ‚Äúplease‚Äù, and ‚Äúcan I have some water please?‚Äù. While, they were a great start, the words didn‚Äôt get me far but definitely kept me hydrated. Luckily, my family and I came across countless selfless people who helped us learn the language. During elementary school, a wonderful volunteer would come to my school and we would sit outside of my classroom in the hallway and learn English through workbooks or reading some books. While my English improved, it was always worse than my fellow classmates. Luckily for me, mathematics was the same regardless of it being in Dari or in Farsi or in English. I started to focus on mathematics and continually justified my sub-par1 scores by saying, ‚ÄúEnglish is not my mother tongue‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am not good at language‚Äù. I continued to have this mindset until I slowly got into self-help books. It was through reading countless self-help books and listening to many speeches and TED talks that I started to plant the seed of a growth mindset.

Over the years, I have really focused on developing my skills with a strong focus on some aspects of soft skills and learning artificial intelligence and machine learning. With this blog, I hope to improve my written communication through sharing my thoughts and experiences around varies subjects. I will primarily focus on technology, personal projects, and anything that has captured my mind and thoughts. With respect to technology, I will focus on learning Kubernetes and Go in the beginning and it will evolve as I focus on different projects. In the process, it would be amazing if this blog teaches the reader something new and/or inspires them to have a growth mindset. ‚ÄúUnfolding my own myth‚Äù On the homepage, you might noticed that I state that I am ‚Äúunfolding my own myth‚Äù. This is an inspiration from Rumi‚Äôs poem, ‚ÄúUnfold Your Own Myth‚Äù. Rumi or Jalal al-Din Balkhi or Mawlana was an Afghan poet that has be an inspiration for me and many Americans. While I enjoy many of his poems, this one has been very motivational and inspiring. Quote Unfold Your Own Myth by: Rumi Who gets up early to discover the moment light begins? Who finds us here circling, bewildered, like atoms? Who, like Jacob blind with grief and age, smells the shirt of his lost son and can see again? Who lets a bucket down and brings up a flowing prophet? Or like Moses goes for fire and finds what burns inside the sunrise? Jesus slips into a house to escape enemies, and opens a door to the other world. Solomon cuts open a fish, and there‚Äôs a gold ring. Omar storms in to kill the prophet and leaves with blessings. But don‚Äôt be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth, so everyone will understand the passage, We have opened you. Start walking toward Shams. Your legs will get heavy and tired. Then comes a moment of feeling the wings you‚Äôve grown, lifting. As I am unfolding my own myth, I hope that you can join me on the journey and hopefully, I can inspire you to unfold your own myth. sub-par in my family meant receiving lower grades than expected; like a B or lower. üòä¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é ","date":"2022-03-05","objectID":"/why_blog/:0:2","tags":["growth mindset","unfolding my myth"],"title":"Why Blog?","uri":"/why_blog/"}]
